As early as 1943, incarcerees created a variety of sports fields and recreational areas in the camp. There were thirteen baseball fields, several basketball, tennis, and volleyball courts, and an ice skating rink. Fields were dispersed throughout the camp between blocks, and judo halls were created in three different block recreational halls. Block 23 had an adjacent outdoor basketball court, baseball fields, and a volleyball court.
 
Many former incarcerees fondly recall ice skating in the winter months. A skating rink was built near Block 21 by Hunt High School physical education students and the Hunt Fire Department. The students dug a pond while the fire department used hydrants to fill the pond in layers, allowing it to freeze in sections over a course of several days.  Other recreation included swimming in one of two swimming holes, also constructed by incarcerees, located adjacent to the root cellar and near Block 30.
