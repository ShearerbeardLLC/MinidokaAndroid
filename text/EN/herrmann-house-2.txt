This house is part of the homestead of John P. Herrmann, a veteran who successfully applied for an unclaimed land lottery property. This 128 acre property encompassed a Minidoka-era fire station, water tower, sewage treatment plant, blocks 21 and 22, portions of several other blocks, and part of the root cellar. Prior to the construction of this home, the Herrmanns resided in the fire station. Herrmann was recalled for active duty in 1950 and wasn't able to develop his farm. In 1952, the North Side Conservation District, the local branch of the US Soil Conservation Service, wrote to Herrmann and asked to use his undeveloped homestead as the site of a Farm-in-a-Day event.
During this event on April 17, 1952, over 1,500 volunteer workers demonstrated state-of-the-art machinery and farming techniques to build a house, dig a well, place fences, level fields, and plant crops. The event received much local publicity before and after it took place, and the Twin Falls Times News reported the next day that 11,321 spectators attended the event, describing it as "bigger than a county fair," "more exciting than a circus," and "organized confusion." The house is the temporary Visitor Center and will be used in the future as NPS offices.
