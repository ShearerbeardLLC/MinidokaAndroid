Nikkei were originally considered unfit for military service due to their perceived disloyalty to the United States. In 1943 Roosevelt activated the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a segregated Nisei unit serving under white officers. Even following the controversy of the loyalty questionnaire, almost 1,000 "yes-yes" or "loyal" Nisei from Minidoka served in the military during WWII.

The 442nd motto "Go for Broke," a gambling term that implies risking everything to win, represents the Nisei attitude in fighting bravely to prove their patriotism.  The 442nd and its attached 100th Infantry Battalion served in Italy, France, Germany, and Northern Africa, becoming the most decorated unit in American military history for its size and length of service. Minidoka supplied more 442nd servicemen than any other incarceration site.  

Many Nisei served in the Pacific front in the Military Intelligence Service (MIS), using Japanese language skills to translate enemy documents, interrogate Japanese prisoners of war, persuade enemies to surrender, or work as radio announcers and propaganda writers. General MacArthur's Intelligence Chief said of the MIS, "The Nisei saved countless Allied lives and shortened the war by two years." Over 300 Nisei women served in the MIS, Army Nurse Corps, and Women's Army Corps, serving as linguists, doctors, nurses, and clerical workers.
