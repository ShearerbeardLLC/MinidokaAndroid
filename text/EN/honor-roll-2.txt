In early 1943 the WRA issued a questionnaire to all adult incarcerees in order to determine loyalty on an individual basis. Those who answered "yes" were eligible to leave incarceration sites for employment, education, and the armed forces. The questionnaires did not account for nuances between Issei and Nisei, or men and women, and two questions in particular became problematic:
No. 27: Are you willing to serve in the armed forces of the United States on combat duty, wherever ordered?
No. 28: Will you swear unqualified allegiance to the United States of American and faithfully defend the United States from any and all attack by foreign or domestic forces, and foreswear any form of allegiance or obedience to the Japanese Emperor, or any other foreign government, power, or organization?
For Issei, barred by law from becoming naturalized U.S. citizens, answering Question 28 "yes" and forswearing allegiance to Japan would leave them nationless. Many Nisei felt no loyalty to the Japanese Emperor and were confused by the question. Many women and elderly Issei were unsure of how to answer the question regarding combat duty.
Overall, 97% of Minidoka's population answered "yes-yes" to the questionnaire, which is the highest "loyalty" rate of the 10 incarceration sites. 335 Minidoka incarcerees who answered "no-no" were branded "disloyals," and sent to Tule Lake, which was converted from an incarceration site to a segregation center. 2,000 "yes-yes" Tule Lake incarcerees were transferred to Minidoka. Of 315 total Nikkei to resist the draft, 40 were from Minidoka. While some "no-no" incarcerees and draft resisters were more loyal to Japan or wanted to avoid military service, others felt it was their American duty to answer "no" in protest of their incarceration. No matter their reasoning, they all experienced the same consequences.
