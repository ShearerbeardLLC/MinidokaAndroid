According to a WRA report on the guard towers, “original plans called for equipping these sentry towers with searchlights and phones, and the towers were to be manned on a 24-hour basis,” but a lack of necessary equipment prevented the towers from being fully used. Though never utilized to their full extent, the guard towers play a large role in the memories of former incarcerees, and often appear in writing, artwork, and oral histories recalling camp years. This psychological impact was noted by the WRA, which reported that “probably no other single factor has had as serious effect on the resident’s morale as the erection of the guard towers.” The report summarized the overall impact of the guard towers when it noted that for incarcerees, “the sentry towers are always silhouetted in the distance. It is not enough that they are not being used - to the residents they stand waiting for the day when they will be used. The eight sentry towers are ever present as a symbol of their confinement.”
