This area, known as the warehouse and motor pool area, contained 17 warehouse buildings, the gas station, and a lavatory. These included a refrigerated warehouse, storage warehouses, maintenance shops, a sign shop, and offices for engineers, carpenters, plumbers, and electricians. Other warehouses served as classrooms for the adult vocational classes to teach incarcerees skills like carpentry, welding, equipment repair, and mechanics. 
 
The large structure that remains today is part of warehouse #5, which served as a motor repair and tire shop. It will be converted into the Minidoka National Historic Site Visitor Center in 2017. The small structure is the warehouse area lavatory.
