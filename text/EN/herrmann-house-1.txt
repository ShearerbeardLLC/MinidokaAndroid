Over time, many incarcerees relocated from Minidoka for education, work, or military service, but many, especially the elderly [Issei] (first generation immigrant from Japan), remained at Minidoka with nowhere to go and lacking the resources to start their lives anew. In the end, the WRA forcibly evicted the remaining incarcerees, providing them with a one way train ticket and $25 cash.
 
Following the official closure of Minidoka on October 28, 1945, the former incarceration center property was transferred back to the Bureau of Reclamation. The government then subdivided the property into farmsteads which were distributed to returning Caucasian veterans through land lotteries. Under the Homestead Act, each winner was required to move onto the land within six months, live there for three years, and cultivate one-sixteenth of the land in that time. Depending on the land parcels, some homesteaders benefitted from the reclamation work accomplished by incarcerees during the war. They each received between 52 and 90 acres, two former Minidoka barracks buildings, one smaller building, and surplus supplies. Converted barracks buildings, foundations, and other remnants still dot the landscape in the surrounding area.
