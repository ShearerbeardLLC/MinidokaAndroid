Below the warehouse and motor pool area and adjacent to Block 22, a bowl-shaped outdoor amphitheater was constructed for large gatherings and outdoor events. The Hunt High School commencement was held here on July 23, 1943. Superintendent of Education Arthur Kleinkopf described the scene in his diary, recalling "A few fleecy clouds rested lazily on the horizon against which the genial sun spread rays of golden light. This huge earthen bowl or amphitheater was backed by rows of barracks beyond which stretched a vast panorama of desert sage with here and there a spot of brighter green where fields of vegetables were growing." The 1943 commencement included 188 students representing 52 different Oregon and Washington high schools, with the young men dressed in blue gowns and the ladies in cream. The Hunt Engineering Section erected a platform within the amphitheater in 1944 for future graduations and memorial ceremonies for Minidoka's fallen soldiers.
