Fire Station #2 apparently served as a multi-purpose space over the camp's operation. [Kleinkopf] (Arthur Kleinkopf. From September 25, 1942, until February 9, 1946, Arthur Kleinkopf was a staff member at Minidoka as supervisor of student teachers and later as superintendent of education.) recorded in his diary: "Attempts to secure Fire Station #2 for use by the auto mechanics class have so far resulted in failure. There is a Japanese fish market there. All attempts to get the proprietors to move the market to another building have met with rebuff." The fish market eventually did move out of Fire Station #2, which was renovated in 1944 to accommodate the auto mechanics class.
