This historic barrack building was one of over 400 residential barracks at Minidoka. The buildings also served as classrooms and church or community offices. Each block held 12 barracks buildings, a recreation hall, a mess hall, and a laundry-lavatory building. The barracks were hastily and cheaply constructed. They consisted of simple wood frame buildings covered with tarpaper, providing no insulation.
Each 20' by 120' barracks building was divided into six smaller apartments to accommodate families. A single barracks included two 16' by 20' apartments, two 20' by 20' apartments, and two 24' by 20' apartments. The smallest apartments housed couples or families of three, the medium units housed families of four or five, and the largest housed six to eight people. Upon arrival, apartments were bare except for a single hanging light bulb, a pot belly stove for heat, and army issued cots, mattresses, and wool blankets.
Though the barracks were divided, the partitions did not extend to the ceiling, leaving gaps for noise to travel between apartments. Beyond the cramped living quarters inside the barracks, each barracks building was spaced only 40 feet apart.
