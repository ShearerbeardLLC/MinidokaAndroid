The Military Police troop housing area was just north of Hunt Road across from the entrance area, and separated from the rest of the camp project area by a barbed wire fence and a private access road. Minidoka was guarded by the 321st Military Police Escort Guard Company under Captain William E. Dorland. While not allowed in the project, the military police patrolled the perimeter fence and acted as guards at the camp entrance station. Incarcerees were granted access to the entire relocation area during the day and were restricted to the residential center at night.
 
In the early months of Minidoka's operation, residents lived on site while some areas were being constructed. These construction areas were guarded by the military police. In September, 1942, an elderly [Issei] (first generation immigrant from Japan) man was shot at, but unharmed, by a military police guard for wandering through a restricted area. Contact between the military police and camp residents was generally limited to interactions at the gate, checking residents and visitors in and out.
