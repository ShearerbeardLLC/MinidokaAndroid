A gas station was necessary to fuel work vehicles, school buses, fire trucks, outside visitors, and keep the camp functioning. It was located within the warehouse and motor pool area in a 9' by 14' building near a motor repair and tire shop. While most of the warehouses no longer remain, the concrete building slabs of the gas station and its filling island remain, though they are cracked and overgrown with vegetation.
 
One [Nisei] (second generation Japanese American; U.S. citizens by birth, born to Japanese immigrants)  firefighter recalled an incident surrounding the gas station, which was about a block away from Fire Station #1. While wartime gas rationing impacted the nation, the Hunt Fire Department was always ensured a steady supply of gas to support their training drills and responding to emergencies. When someone siphoned fuel from one of the fire trucks, the firefighter expressed the type of moral quandary sometimes felt during incarceration: "It was wrong to take the gasoline for personal use to give to someone but under the circumstance of the government putting us in such a situation it was quite easy to look the other way."
