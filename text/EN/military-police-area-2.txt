[WRA] (War Relocation Authority. The government agency responsible for the administration of the War Relocation Centers where Japanese Americans were held during World War II.) employee and [Nikkei] (people of Japanese ancestry, Japanese emigrants and their descendants) incarceree sentiments towards the military police understandably varied. Many Nikkei still recall the presence of armed guards and the psychological impact it had on their Minidoka experience. In contrast, [Arthur Kleinkopf] (From September 25, 1942, until February 9, 1946, Arthur Kleinkopf was a staff member at Minidoka as supervisor of student teachers and later as superintendent of education.) recorded in his diary the military police's laidback approach to checking him in, as he successfully used a calling card, social security card, health insurance card, various receipts, and hunting and fishing license in place of his WRA-issued pass to gain entrance into camp.
  
One WRA-employed teacher recalled the irony of military police guarding the families of American service members, illustrated by the construction of the Honor Roll at the heavily guarded camp entrance, and noted that some of the military police were bothered by this irony and wondered why they were even needed there.
