Incarcerees built this root cellar in 1943 using tarpaper, straw bales, and sod. In just a few years' time, incarcerees converted some 700 acres of sagebrush into fertile crops. By 1944, they were able to completely provide for Minidoka's produce needs, as well as run successful hog and poultry farms. A farmers' dining hall was eventually built to feed farm laborers closer to the fields.
 
Many Minidoka [Nikkei] (people of Japanese ancestry, Japanese emigrants and their descendants) also used agriculture as a means of improving their living situation. Victory gardens and community vegetable gardens appeared between barracks and near the schools, with everyone from elementary students to elderly [Issei] (first generation immigrant from Japan) tending to their plots. These gardens beautified the living space and supplemented a government rations-based diet with familiar Japanese vegetables such as [daikon] (large white radish), [nappa] (asian cabbage), [gobo] (burdock root), [azuki] (sweet red beans), and [shingiku] (edible chrysanthemum).
