This is a historic mess hall that has been returned to Block 22. Each block had a central mess hall, 40' x 100' in size, designed to accommodate 304 people during scheduled meals. In each of ten incarceration sites, the [WRA] (War Relocation Authority. The government agency responsible for the administration of the War Relocation Centers where Japanese Americans were held during World War II.)  allotted $.45 per day per person for food. It was noted that this amount "does not permit the buying of the better foods. The milk situation is still bad. One-half cup per meal is allowed the children less than 12 years of age, elderly people, invalids, and pregnant mothers."
 
WRA employees also dined at an employee mess hall, and several recalled the food as being basically good overall, but with a large emphasis on fish, which they disliked.  [Kleinkopf] (Arthur Kleinkopf. From September 25, 1942, until February 9, 1946, Arthur Kleinkopf was a staff member at Minidoka as supervisor of student teachers and later as superintendent of education.) recorded his daily meals in his diary and gives insight into the varying quality of meals. One day he recorded, "Lunch poor. Wieners and sauerkraut. Kraut too rotten. Soup made from greasy mutton and was full of curry powder which I do not like." A few months later, "We had another one of those rare dinners today. It consisted of roast pork, dressing, peas, carrots, potatoes, cake, coffee, and cold tea. This happens about once a month."
