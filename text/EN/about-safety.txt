On February 19, 1942, in the panic following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. This authorized the U.S. Army to forcibly remove approximately 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry from their West Coast homes. Of this group, two-thirds were American citizens, and the remaining population was prohibited by U.S. law from obtaining citizenship. They were first sent to temporary detention centers in race tracks and fairgrounds for several months. They were then sent to one of ten War Relocation Centers, or long-term incarceration sites, for the duration of the war. From October 1942 to August 1945, Minidoka housed over 13,000 incarcerees. 

The largest population of Minidoka incarcerees came from Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and surrounding areas. Around 200 Japanese Alaskans also made up the original Minidoka population. In 1943, 1,900 transferred to Minidoka from Tule Lake when Tule Lake was set aside as a segregation center for suspected "disloyals." Another 227, originally from Bainbridge Island, Washington, voluntarily transferred from Manzanar to Minidoka to be closer to contacts from the Seattle area. Officially designated the Minidoka War Relocation Center, Minidoka was locally referred to as the Hunt Camp. It received its own postal designation of Hunt, Idaho, since Minidoka already referred to an Idaho town located 35 miles northeast. The names are often used interchangeably today. 

The congressional Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, established by congress in 1980, found that Executive Order 9066 was not justified by military necessity and that "the broad historical causes that shaped these decisions were race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership." No evidence of wartime espionage or sabotage by a Japanese national or Japanese American was ever found.
