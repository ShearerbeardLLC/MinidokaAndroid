An Honor Roll for incarcerees from Minidoka who joined the military was dedicated on October 14, 1943. Originally only consisting of the center panel, the two side panels were added as the number of Minidoka military recruits swelled. By the end of the war, almost 1,000 Minidoka [Nisei] (second generation Japanese American; U.S. citizens by birth, born to Japanese immigrants) were listed.  Respected [Issei] (first generation immigrant from Japan) artists, Kamekichi Tokita and Kenjiro Nomura, were sign makers in camp and designed and painted the Honor Roll.
The Honor Roll stood in front of a Japanese style garden designed by Fujitaro Kubota, a famous Japanese landscape designer from Seattle. The arranged basalt boulders and earthen mounds are all that remains of the garden. It originally included stepping stones, a water feature, trees, shrubs, and flowers. The contrast of the traditional Japanese style entrance garden, nearby entrance gate and guard tower, and the Honor Roll, signifying patriotism and loyalty, represents the complex and sometimes conflicting cultural values of the incarcerated [Nikkei] (people of Japanese ancestry, Japanese emigrants and their descendants).
This replica of the historic Honor Roll was unveiled on July 3, 2011 and honors the legacy of the Minidoka incarcerees who entered military service. The basalt stepping stones and pathways leading to the Honor Roll were placed by incarcerees.
