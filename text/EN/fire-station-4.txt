Stepping up on the home front, like many women around the nation during WWII, an all-female fire crew helped staff Fire Station #2. Though Fire Chief W. L. Yeager initially released a call for "30 women fire wardens between 19 and 35," a crew of nine women was chosen. Like the men, they worked 24 hours on followed by 48 hours off duty. The crew included Assistant Chief Tsugi Kodama, Captain Margaret Fukutomi, driver Hanako Tokumasu, Takako Masumoto, Collete Kawaguchi, Chieko Mukawa, and Mary Mukasa.  
 
The Twin Falls Times News ran a story on the female fire crew, attributing their necessity to the drain on manpower while countless men left the center on work release to help with the local sugar beet and potato harvest.  The article reads: "They man one of the two fire stations, carrying out all duties from driving a truck to holding the nozzle of a high-pressure hose, which is a job that grown men don't master without training," and that "The girls showed both attention to business and a spirit of adventure as they went through their drill in the routine that might become necessary for an actual blaze at any time."
