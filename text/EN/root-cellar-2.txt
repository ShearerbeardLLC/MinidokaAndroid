Incarcerees also contributed to the war effort on the home front by working in agriculture beyond the confinement site boundaries. By October of 1942, 1885 newly arrived incarcerees already left to work in the harvest of local beet and potato crops, as local communities had lost much of their labor force to the war. As late as 1982, one local newspaper reported that "the Hunt residents were credited with possibly saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in crop losses in the local sugar beet and potato crops..."
 
Harvest was a critical time in Minidoka's farms as well as local farms, and involved the efforts of Minidoka incarcerees of all ages. Robert Coombs, a [WRA] (War Relocation Authority. The government agency responsible for the administration of the War Relocation Centers where Japanese Americans were held during World War II.)  teacher, recalled:
 
"I would take my core classes out in big trucks, along with other teachers and classes, and we would clear the sage from the soil, pile it up and burn it. We would go out and harvest beets, carrots, radishes, turnips, and potatoes."
For the month of October each year, Hunt High School students were released on harvest vacation. Both students and teachers worked harvesting the Minidoka crops, while others opted to earn money by working in fields across Southern Idaho.
