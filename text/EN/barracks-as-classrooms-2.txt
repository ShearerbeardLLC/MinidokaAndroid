Vocational learning was a success, as students could earn school credit and support camp operation by working part-time in many capacities, such as secretaries, journalists, teachers' aides, nurses' aides, and more. Continuing education programs trained adults in skilled labor such as welding, carpentry, and auto repair. As WRA teachers came in increasingly short supply, incarcerees with college degrees were often hired to fill in. Even high school students were encouraged to help with the younger grades.
 
School activities kept both students and parents busy, as the camp's Parent-Teacher Association was one of the largest in the state, with over 200 members for each of the elementary schools and nearly 500 for the high school. Students were active with after-school jobs, sports teams, class victory gardens, pep bands, boy and girl scouts, and more. One WRA teacher recalled having "activities Saturday afternoons, and Saturday evenings we had dances. Friday evenings we would have parties for one reason or another. We would make up reasons for parties," to keep the students busy and out of their cramped living quarters.
