This is the site of a former baseball field that was reconstructed in 2016. Baseball and softball were popular throughout the camp, with blocks forming teams and competing. There were "Old Stars" teams for those 26 years and older, women's teams, and a highly accomplished semi-professional team. The semi-pro team, the Hunt Center All-Stars, was undefeated in the region in 1943, and competed in the Idaho State Semi-Professional Tournament that July in Idaho Falls. They moved into the semi-finals by defeating the Hunt Military Police team 14-1. 
 
The pride of Minidoka was the Hunt High School Wolverines baseball team. They traveled outside the camp to compete, and often greatly outscored local opponents. In 1945, it was recorded that they defeated the Eden High School team 21-0 in only three innings. When they hosted a game against Twin Falls High School at the center, nearly 4,000 incarcerees gathered to watch Hunt High defeat Twin Falls 16-4.
