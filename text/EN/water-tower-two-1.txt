Situated in the brush behind Fire Station #1 and the Herrmann house, the large cement foundations of Water Tower #2 still remain. The water towers were the tallest structures in camp, looming in the horizon above the barracks and guard towers.
 
Morrison-Knudsen Company completed the camp water infrastructure by October 1942.  This included four deep ground wells, which pumped water to one of two large water towers, then to the mess hall and H-shaped lavatory-laundry building in each residential block. This provided well water for laundering, showering and bathing, and cooking and drinking.
