Minidoka's WRA-hired staff was in some ways subject to the same living conditions as the incarcerees, resulting in a high turn-around and often a shortage of staff. Kleinkopf observed this difficulty in keeping staff, and remarked that "it takes a great deal of pioneering spirit and patience to endure." Upon arrival at Minidoka, teacher Robert Coombs recalled "They assigned me to room C which was all right with me as it was a place to sleep. I then asked about a place to eat and he told me there was a dining room. I responded with, 'Well, that is all I need.' So I moved into my room without much furniture, to say the least, but that didn't bother me. This was going to be a challenge and I was ready for it."
Contrary to incarceree barracks, staff dormitories had indoor showers and toilets and were later furnished by the WRA, and an incarceree cleaning staff was provided for daily housekeeping. The elderly women sometimes cleaned the dormitories twice a day to combat dust storms. This housing was offered to staff at a rental rate of approximately $22.50 per month.
