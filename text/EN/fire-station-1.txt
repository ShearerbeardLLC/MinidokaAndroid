One [Nisei] (second generation Japanese American, U.S. citizen by birth) firefighter, Norio Mitsuoka described the fire station as a prime facility compared to the rest of the camp, recalling that he and another fireman, Jimmy Okamoto, "were rather fortunate in the way of living quarters because we were bachelors and were working for the fire department. Although we were assigned a block living quarter, we gave that up and moved into the fire station." 
 
The physical appearance of Fire Station #1 remains largely unchanged: "In the back of the station house there were two small rooms. Jimmy and I occupied one of the rooms and the other was used for storage. The station house had a shower and sink and toilet facilities built inside so we were saved the inconveniences that the majority of evacuees faced. We even had a refrigerator."
 
Fire Station #1 even had a black and white mixed-breed "fire station mutt" for its mascot, which appears in several historic photos of the fire crew.
