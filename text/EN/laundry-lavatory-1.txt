Each block's laundry-lavatory building consisted of a communal laundry room, a boiler room, and separate facilities for men and women with communal showers and toilets. The supplied laundry facilities consisted of large washtubs and wash boards. A few families were eventually able to send for their washing machines from home, but this was a rarity. In the high school block, the laundry room served as a makeshift lab for the chemistry classes. The boiler room allowed for hot water, all of which was heated by coal. While toilets and women's showers were eventually partitioned, men's showers were not partitioned. For many, especially the women, this lack of privacy was one of the most difficult aspects of life at Minidoka. Four bathtubs were provided in each women's lavatory, primarily for the elderly.
