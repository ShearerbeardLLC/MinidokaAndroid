Firefighting was a necessary occupation at Minidoka. For some, the job was appealing because it involved 24-hour shifts with 48 hours off in between. For others, it meant an exciting opportunity to explore beyond project boundaries, often on overnight camping trips, when assisting the [Grazing Service] (U.S. Grazing Service, now the Bureau of Land Management) in wildland firefighting.
 
Mitsuoka recalled fighting fires in Idaho towns like [Minidoka] (a town 35 miles Northeast of Minidoka National Historic Site), Hailey, Gooding, Burley, and American Falls, and visiting attractions like Craters of the Moon National Monument and underground lava tubes. He noted in his autobiography, "during the time we were at Minidoka Relocation Center we helped in the suppression of fires during 3 fire seasons." The Grazing Service provided the Minidoka volunteers with transportation, equipment, meals, bedding, and paid $.60 per hour of active firefighting.
