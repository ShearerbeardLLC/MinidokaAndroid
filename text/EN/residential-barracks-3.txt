Incarcerees quickly drew on their resourcefulness to enhance and personalize their surroundings, both in their apartments and outdoors. Early on, a supply of lumber intended for construction was guarded by the Internal Security Section, a police force consisting of 50 [Issei] (first generation immigrant from Japan) men. On this, one incarceree remarked, "Since the police are Japanese Issei, they overlook most things." Another recalls, "We were able to walk off with quite a few pieces of 1 x 12 western pine lumber...As dusk approached we could look down to the lumber storage area and literally see lumber walking off in many directions." Much of this lumber was used in apartments, for necessary furnishings including tables, dressers, and chairs. [Kleinkopf] (Arthur Kleinkopf. From September 25, 1942, until February 9, 1946, Arthur Kleinkopf was a staff member at Minidoka as supervisor of student teachers and later as superintendent of education.) noticed that "shelves and bookcases mysteriously appear overnight and are found next day in classrooms which the day before were barren." Issei artist Kamekichi Tokita expressed the emotional benefits of making homes out of barracks when he recorded in his diary that "I created [a] cupboard by putting junk boards together, which made me happy and gave me a great sense of accomplishment." Additional furnishings and homeware such as wallpaper, drapes, bedspreads, were eventually ordered through Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck catalogs.
