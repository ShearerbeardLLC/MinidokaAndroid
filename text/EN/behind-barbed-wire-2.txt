On January 17, 2001, President William Clinton designated 72.75 acres as Minidoka Internment National Monument. Clinton saw Minidoka to be "a unique and irreplaceable historical resource which protects historic structures and objects that provide opportunities for public education and interpretation of an important chapter in American history -- the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II."
 
Minidoka Internment National Monument was renamed Minidoka National Historic Site in 2008 under President Bush with a law that also expanded the site. In 2011 the historic reconstruction of the Honor Roll was installed and dedicated, an original barrack and mess hall were moved back to Block 22, the 1.6 mile interpretive trail was constructed, the NPS entrance sign was installed, the barbed-wire fence at the entrance area was installed, and historic barracks, mess hall, and fire station were stabilized and rehabilitated. The entrance Guard Tower was installed in 2014, the result of a partnership between NPS, the Friends of Minidoka, and Boise State University Construction Management Department. In May 2016 the baseball field was recreated in a single day by Friends of Minidoka, NPS, and 200 volunteers.
