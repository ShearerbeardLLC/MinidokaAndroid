The former sewage treatment center is located on the [Herrmann] (John Herrmann, a veteran who acquired 128 acres on the former location of Minidoka's fire station, water tower, sewage treatment facility, blocks 21, 22, and portions of other blocks through a land lottery.) farm site. It was a critical component of camp infrastructure to support a population around 10,000 people. Incarcerees were without proper sewage for the first several months the camp was in operation. They were forced to use outdoor latrines, located close to the main road, in the frigid Idaho winter. This early period was marked by widespread ptomaine poisoning as a result of flooding latrines.  
 
The sewage treatment plant began operation on February 4, 1943. Sewage flowed from each block lavatory to the treatment center, which included digesters, filters, clarifiers, chlorine tanks, and a pump house, and went on to rest in a sewage lagoon three miles south.
 
The close proximity of the sewage treatment plant to administrative offices and housing was a subject of contention for [WRA] (War Relocation Authority. The government agency responsible for the administration of the War Relocation Centers where Japanese Americans were held during World War II.) staff, as recorded in the diary of [Arthur Kleinkopf] (From September 25, 1942, until February 9, 1946, Arthur Kleinkopf was a staff member at Minidoka as supervisor of student teachers and later as superintendent of education.). He noted that "appetites are now quite often adversely affected by the foulness of the air," and that residents in nearby Blocks 10 and 12 complained of  mosquito swarms caused by sewage overflow.
