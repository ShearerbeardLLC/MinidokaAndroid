This portion of barbed wire fence represents the five-mile fence that once surrounded Minidoka's perimeter and residential areas. Construction of the fence occurred from October to December 1942, several months after the first incarcerees had arrived. This was a point of contention for incarcerees, leading them to submit formal protests against the fence to [WRA] (War Relocation Authority. The government agency responsible for the administration of the War Relocation Centers where Japanese Americans were held during World War II.)  administration. The fence was removed from residential areas by April 1943. Perimeter fence near the hospital, warehouse, military police, and administration areas remained until the closure of Minidoka.
