The hospital area was part of the project's inner core that included the military police area, administrative area, sewage treatment plant, and warehouse area. Construction of the hospital complex was completed in October 1942. The hospital employed 200 people, both incarcerees and [WRA] (War Relocation Authority. The government agency responsible for the administration of the War Relocation Centers where Japanese Americans were held during World War II.) employees.
 
The hospital complex consisted of eighteen buildings which included surgery, pediatrics, maternity, and isolation wards, an optical clinic, dental clinic, pharmacy, morgue, and housing for WRA-hired doctors and nurses. These buildings were modified barracks with the addition of painted wood siding and interior walls. Boasting one of the project's best-equipped kitchens and most popular dining halls, the hospital area received its own dehydrating plant and cannery in September 1943.
 
Though the hospital had two army ambulances, many incarcerees remember walking, sometimes upwards of two miles in harsh conditions, to receive medical services or even give birth. Hospital records documented 489 births and 193 deaths during Minidoka's operation.
