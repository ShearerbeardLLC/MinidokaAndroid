Friends of Minidoka (FoM) engages in and supports education, research and historic preservation of the WWII Japanese American incarceration experience. We strive to pass on the history, legacy, and lessons of civil liberties through transforming and inspiring experiences for the general public and those with personal and familial ties to Minidoka. We are committed to working with partners, including the National Park Service, to accomplish these goals.

By supporting the Friends of Minidoka, you are supporting site preservation, educational programming, and historic research. Past projects led by FoM include the historic reconstruction of the Honor Roll, Guard Tower, and Baseball Field. Programmatic events include the annual Minidoka Civil Liberties Symposium and support for site tours and off-site education.
