One result of communal dining was an overall breakdown in family structure during incarceration. Many [Nisei] (second generation Japanese American; U.S. citizens by birth, born to Japanese immigrants) youth dined together with friends in the mess hall of their choice, sometimes twice during one meal time. While incarcerees were intended to eat in their own block's mess hall, it wasn't always the case: "Chef in one dining hall complaining that people from other blocks are eating in his dining hall. Says some are eating twice - once in his mess and once in the adjoining block." The [Issei] (first generation immigrant from Japan) experience with this was less positive, as they felt at a loss to regain control of a traditionally patriarchal family structure. Kleinkopf observed this, noting, "Many Japanese deplore the fact that they no longer have any home life, can no longer sit together at the dinner table and talk over the day's events."
