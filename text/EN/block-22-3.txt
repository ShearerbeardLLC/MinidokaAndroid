All of the Minidoka church offices were located in Block 22, Barracks 1 and 3. Six Protestant denominations in Minidoka joined under the umbrella organization of the Federated Christian Church. [Nikkei] (people of Japanese ancestry, Japanese emigrants and their descendants)  Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian ministers Tsutomu Fukuyama, Naomichi Kodaira, Henry Sakuma, and Gennosuke Shoji were paid by their individual church mission boards. The Episcopal Church had its own services and a separate office for Reverend Joseph Kitagawa. There was also a Catholic Church office for Maryknoll pastor L.H. Tibesar. Many of these ministers, as well as Caucasian missionaries, followed their congregations from the Seattle area to support them during their incarceration at Minidoka. There was also a United Buddhist Church office, with worship services held for practitioners of the Shinshu, Shingon, and Nichiren Buddhist sects. Worship services were held at churches in recreation halls throughout the housing blocks. Many youth at Minidoka participated in church youth groups within camp and even went to Christian summer camps outside of Minidoka, including in Sun Valley.
