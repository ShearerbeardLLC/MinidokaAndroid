The stretch of agricultural land northeast of Block 22 once held Block 23, and with it, two schools. The continued education of children was a top priority for many incarcerees. Huntville Elementary School operated in barracks in Block 10, Stafford Elementary School in Block 32, and Hunt Middle and Hunt High School in Block 23. Nursery schools, provided for Minidoka's youngest residents, existed in Blocks 4, 16, 26, 36, and 40. Construction of a high school gymnasium and auditorium began in September 1943, though it was never completed due to labor disputes. The large structure was used for some large gatherings even in its incomplete state.
 
At first, schools were unfurnished and undersupplied. [Kleinkopf] (Arthur Kleinkopf. From September 25, 1942, until February 9, 1946, Arthur Kleinkopf was a staff member at Minidoka as supervisor of student teachers and later as superintendent of education.) recorded, "One teacher has seventy-five fifth grade pupils in a room 20' x 30'... There are no chairs, no blackboards... and not even the minimum amount of needed supplies." Books supplied to the camp were outdated, with health class textbooks published in 1896. [WRA] (War Relocation Authority. The government agency responsible for the administration of the War Relocation Centers where Japanese Americans were held during World War II.) employed teachers often grew frustrated at the lack of supplies and harsh living conditions. While some felt encouraged to fulfill their assignment as contributing to the war effort, others faced pressure for their involvement with the Japanese American "enemies."
