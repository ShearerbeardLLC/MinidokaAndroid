Sentiments varied widely among WRA workers towards the incarceration of Japanese Americans. Some considered work at Minidoka as contributing to the war effort, and genuinely cared for the incarcerees. Coombs recalled that at camp "I soon became a worrier because I wanted them all to succeed in everything they were doing in the school." Coombs experienced backlash against his involvement with Nikkei from his former employer, the superintendent of Sacramento schools, who told him 'Don't you ever come back and ask for a job here in Sacramento.' [Kleinkopf] (Arthur Kleinkopf. From September 25, 1942, until February 9, 1946, Arthur Kleinkopf was a staff member at Minidoka as supervisor of student teachers and later as superintendent of education.) observed negative attitudes towards [Nikkei] (people of Japanese ancestry, Japanese emigrants and their descendants) within the WRA staff at Minidoka, noting that "Some of the appointed personnel employed at the center are too anti-Japanese in their attitudes and actions for the good of the project and the policies of WRA." Other employees remained in contact with their incarceree friends for years after camp closure, even attending reunions in postwar years.
