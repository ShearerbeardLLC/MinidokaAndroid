Eight guard towers stood sentry around the perimeter of the camp like this historically reconstructed model. Construction of the guard towers and barbed wire fence began in November 1942, several months after the first incarcerees arrived. While some [WRA] (War Relocation Authority. The government agency responsible for the administration of the War Relocation Centers where Japanese Americans were held during World War II.) centers had very strict rules against incarcerees leaving, Minidoka had daily, temporary, and long-term leave clearances for incarcerees to attend school, work outside of camp, run errands in nearby towns, and visit friends. Confusion existed as to why the watch towers were necessary since Minidoka had already been operating without them and was in such a desolate location. 
 
Before their construction, [Kleinkopf] (Arthur Kleinkopf. From September 25, 1942, until February 9, 1946, Arthur Kleinkopf was a staff member at Minidoka as supervisor of student teachers and later as superintendent of education.) recorded that “The reason for the towers is being discussed by many Japanese and some appointed personnel. Some say they are fire lookouts and others maintain that the sole purpose is to have them manned by soldiers with machine guns to prevent the escape of any evacuee. In the block managers meeting today it was said that... it is the responsibility of all those who leave the center to work outside to prove to the white Americans that the Japanese are willing to do their share and can be relied upon and that the towers are for Japanese protection and must be regarded as such.”
