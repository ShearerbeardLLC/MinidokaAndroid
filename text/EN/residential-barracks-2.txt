Incarcerees were subject to all of the extremes of Idaho's high desert climate. These conditions were made harsher when compared to the mild weather of Seattle or Portland, where the majority of incarcerees were from. The winter of 1942 brought almost record low temperatures, with one nearby town reaching -20 Â°F. There was no respite from the cold that winter, as coal deliveries were delayed and incarcerees took to burning sagebrush outside for warmth. Winter and spring were accompanied by extremely muddy conditions, while summers were hot, dry, and dusty, with temperatures over 104 degrees and even rattlesnakes seeking shade near barracks.
The green pine used for construction would eventually dry and shrink, creating cracks between boards. This allowed dust, snow, heat, and cold to drift into apartments. Many incarceree women recall the endless frustration of trying to keep their homes clean. The dust was an inescapable part of camp life: "A windy, dusty day. Nothing can be kept clean. Dust, dirt, and sand get in our hair, eyes, noses, and throats. It comes in through the countless cracks around the windows, doors, floors, and roofs."
