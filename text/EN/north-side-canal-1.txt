Prior to the war, the land that would become the wartime confinement site was part of a Bureau of Reclamation irrigation project called the Minidoka Project. The North Side Canal was part of the Minidoka Project and later served as the southern boundary of the Minidoka War Relocation Center. Though North Side Canal directly bordered the camp, it was at a lower elevation and pumping the water would have been costly. Milner-Gooding Canal, five miles away, was used instead to irrigate project farmland and residential area victory gardens. Incarcerees constructed a lateral canal from Milner-Gooding to designated areas in May 1943. In addition to this 7 mile long, up to 17 mile wide lateral canal, incarcerees built a complex network of irrigation and drainage ditches which transformed over 700 acres of sagebrush land into an agricultural oasis. The present-day agricultural character of the area is a legacy of [Nikkei] (people of Japanese ancestry, Japanese emigrants and their descendants) labor during wartime incarceration.
